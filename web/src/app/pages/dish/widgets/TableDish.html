        People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a
        way to succeed. </p>

        You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust
        that
        the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma,
        whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

        The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them
        as
        believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who
        will be sharing the adventure with them.

        Success is ... knowing your purpose in life, growing to reach your maximum potential, and sowing seeds that
        benefit others.

      <p>Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.</p>
